If set to `deploy`, will attempt to deploy the preview and overwrite any existing preview in that location. If set to `remove`, will attempt to remove the preview in that location. If set to `auto`, the action will try to determine whether to deploy or remove the preview. It will deploy the preview on `pull_request.types.synchronize` and `.opened` events, and remove it on `pull_request.types.closed` events. It will not do anything for all other events. `auto` is the default value.
